				<h3>Swords:</h3> <br>

					<div class="swordsUL">
						<h4>Shortswords</h4>	
							<p class="paragraphs">Knives such as the seax and other blades of similar length – between 1 and 2 feet (~ 30 cm and 60 cm) – are sometimes construed as swords. This is especially the case for weapons from antiquity, made before the development of high quality steel that is necessary for longer swords.</p>
						<h4>Longswords</h4>  
							<p class="paragraphs">The longsword as a late medieval type of sword emerges in the 14th century, as a military steel weapon of the earlier phase of the Hundred Years' War. It remains identifiable as a type during the period of about 1350 to 1550. It remained in use as a weapon of war intended for wielders wearing full plate armour either on foot or on horseback, throughout the late medieval period. From the late 15th century, however, it is also attested as being worn and used by unarmoured soldiers or mercenaries. </p>
						<h4>Backswords</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">A type of sword characterised by having a single-edged blade and a hilt with a single-handed grip. It is so called because the triangular cross section gives a flat back edge opposite the cutting edge. Later examples often have a "false edge" on the back near the tip, which was in many cases sharpened to make an actual edge and facilitate thrusting attacks.Historically, these classic blades outperformed the katana in a fight! 
						<h4>Sabres</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">A type of backsword with a curved blade associated with the light cavalry of the early modern and Napoleonic periods. It is technically an upgrade over the traditional backsword, with the curve allowing for easier damage to enemies.
						<h4>Katanas</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">The Katana is the worlds most desireable sword. It has been sought after for generations, and treated as a part of the samurai's soul. Japanese Swords are many things: functional objects of martial tradition, the very soul of the Samurai, and artistic creations of unparalleled beauty.</p>

				<div class="block2">Armor, wrought and hammered</div><br><h4>Armor:</h4> <br>
					<div class="armorUL">
						<h4>Chainmail</h4>	
							<p class="paragraphs">With flexibility similar to cloth and greater than hardened leather, mail allows for exellent mobility. Due to the way it drapes over the body its weight is evenly distributed, making it less fatiguing than most other armors.</p>
						<h4>Splint mail</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">Limb armor consisting of strips of metal ("splints") are attached to a fabric (cloth or leather) backing ("foundation"). The splints are narrow metal strips arranged longitudinally, pierced for riveting or sewing to the foundation. Splint armour is most commonly found as greaves or vambraces. While a few complete suits of armour have been found made from splints of wood, leather, or bone, the Victorian neologism "splinted mail" usually refers to the limb protections of crusader knights.</p>
						<h4>Scalemail</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">Scale mail is an early form of armour consisting of many individual small armour scales (plates) of various shapes attached to each other and to a backing of cloth or leather in overlapping rows. Scale armour was worn by warriors of many different cultures as well as their horses.</p>
						<h4>Plate mail</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">Full plate armour was expensive to produce and remained therefore restricted to the upper strata of society; lavishly decorated suits of armour remained the fashion with 18th-century nobles and generals long after they had ceased to be militarily useful on the battlefield due to the advent of inexpensive muskets.  </p>
						<h4>Half-plate</h4>
							<p class="paragraphs">Think of it like this, if Plate Mail was the entire discography, Half Plate would be a "Greatest Hits" album.</p>
